# Study Notion

Study Notion is a comprehensive learning management system (LMS) built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It offers a platform for instructors to create and manage courses, deliver content, and interact with students, while allowing students to access course materials and track their progress.

## Features

- User Authentication (Sign Up, Log In, Log Out)
- Course Management (Create, Update, Delete Courses)
- Content Delivery (Videos, Documents, Quizzes)
- User Interaction (Discussions, Forums)
- Progress Tracking (Track Student Progress)

- Technologies Used:
  - React
  - Redux Toolkit
  - RTK Query
  - Node.js
  - MongoDB
  - Cloudinary
  - Tailwind CSS
  - LocalStorage

## How I Made It

- **State Management:** Utilized Redux Toolkit for state management, ensuring a predictable and efficient state handling mechanism. LocalStorage is employed for auto-login and persistent behavior.

- **Data Fetching:** Implemented Axios for better Data fetching

- **Styling:** Achieved perfect styling using Tailwind CSS, enabling rapid development and consistent design.

- **User-Based System:** Integrated MongoDB and Redux Toolkit to facilitate user-based interactions such as follow/unfollow. Cloudinary is utilized for photo uploading in posts and profiles.
